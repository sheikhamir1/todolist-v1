Hello, this is Sheikh Amir This is my TodoList version 1. Before this, I created a TodoList, and we have updated it, adding some interesting features and making the UI more user-friendly.

In this version, users can:

Add tasks
Delete any task
Mark a task as complete after completion
Update a task, whether marked or unmarked
There is no limit to adding tasks; users can add as many tasks as they want
Since there is no limit to the tasks, we have also provided a filter option below:

Users can view all tasks, whether complete or incomplete, and see the total
By filtering, users can see how many tasks are incomplete and how many are complete
In the filter option, users also have the option to delete all tasks by selecting them, whether complete or incomplete



works
